<p>All that is left for you to do is click the 'Create' button.  The map will then be colour-adjusted, warped into NZTM2000 projection, tiled, and the resulting images compressed.  All this takes quite a while - up to 10 minutes.  Feel free to navigate away from the screen and do something else in the meantime (if you do this, your map may not be visible when you return. Hit F5 - refresh - to clear cached data before returning to view your map).</p>
<p>Once complete, you can find your map under Maptalk-&gtBrowse. Check that is is displayed correctly and in the right location by comparing it with the standard topomaps</p>
