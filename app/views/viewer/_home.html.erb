  <h1> Current and historical topographic maps (topomaps) of New Zealand </h1>
  <p> The site hosts 'the latest maps' as of the last day of each decade from 1949 to 2009.  
      Available map series are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> 1959 NZMS1 1:63360 (1 inch)</li>
    <li> 1969 NZMS1 1:63360 (1 inch)</li>
    <li> 1979 NZMS1 1:63360 (1 inch)</li>
    <li> 1989 NZMS1/NZMS260 transition</li>
    <li> 1999 NZMS260 1:50000</li>
    <li> 2009 Topo50 1:50000</li>
  </ul>
  <p>  Work on 1949 (early NZMS1 1st editions) has yet to commence. Once map generation is completed, improving the web interface is the next goal.</p>
